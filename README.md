### CodePath: Rapid prototyping of Dropbox key UX features

The purpose of this prototype is to demonstrate the onboarding flow for existing Dropbox users. 

Use the following login detais to use this prototype:
username: tim
password: 12345

**The prototype was designed to be demoed on an iPhone 5s screen size.**

Time spent: **12 hours**

## Notes
**Challenges encountered during the creation of this prototype:** 

1. Creating the moving photos effect on the root viewcontroller was too time consuming for me to complete in time. I still intend on finishing this effect.
